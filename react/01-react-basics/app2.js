// HEADER COMPONENT
// React component defined as a JS stateless functional component.
// Component's name is required to begin with an upper case letter to differentiate from native DOM elements
/*

  // note the parenthesis for the multiline return

    <header>
      <h1>Scoreboard</h1>
      <span className="stats">Players: 1</span>

// Enable the use of props using parameter (commonly) called props

// COUNTER COMPONENT
// Defined as a JS stateful class component:
class Counter extends React.Component {
  
  // Initialisation of state (available only locally within this componenet -> component state)
  // constructor() is a special method to outline (initialise) the properties of the class. When creating an object of this class, this is the method that gets called (you can pass it parameters):
  /*
  constructor() {
    super()   // To call the constructor of the React.Component class (called before any use of 'this.'):
    this.state = {     // Initialise the component's state (must be called 'state', it is a special keyword): an object that stores all data that the component needs, and that might be passed down to its children
      score: 0
    };
  }
  */
  // The initialisation of the component's state above can be shortened with JSX/Babel as (must be called state, it is a speciial keyword)
  state = {
    score: 0
  };

  // Change state: pass an object with the properties to chage. It will trigger a call to render().
  // By default, any custom method of a class component that extends React.Component are not bound to the component ('this.' won't work, it's undefined). To bind them, one needs to pass the context upon calling the decrementScore method in the event handler (see below).
  decrementScore() {
    console.log(this);  // --> undefined, unless context is passed
    this.setState(
      // It's better to use a callback function when setting a state (don't rely simply on this.state = something directly), since setState can be asynchronous: more requests (clicks) might be done before rendering is done, several request might be bundled for performance reasons, etc. So it's better to update based on the retrieved previous state (the parameter in the arrow function passed to this.State will be understood in React to be the previous state).
      prevState => ({
        score: (prevState.score > 0) ? prevState.score - 1 : prevState.score = 0
      })
    );
  }

  // Taking advantage of the lexical this binding of arrow functions, we can rewrite the analogous increment method as:
  incrementScore = () => {
    console.log(this);  // --> always defined
    this.setState(
      prevState => ({
        score: prevState.score + 1
      })
    );
  }
  
  // render() is must in a React.Component subblass
  // Access the components' props or states with this.props and this.state for stateless functional componenets and class components, repectively.
  // It get's called everytime there's a change in props or state.
  // React event (simlar to JS events, written with camelCase) added to buttons.
  // We pass the context for 'this' (the created instance of the Counter class) on the reference to decrementScore with either
  // A) this.decrementScore.bind(this) [note the lack of parenthesis on the reference to the method --this.decrementScore and not this.decrementScore()--: adding them would call the function at page load, which is not desired -- we only want to call it on demand/click)]; or
  // B) () => this.decrementScore() [note the parenthesis], by taking advantage of lexical-this-binding of arrow functions (automatically binds them to the scope where they are defined, here being inside render, an instance of the Counter component instance)
  // C) If we defined the method already as an arrow function (as it is for the increment method), we only need to reference the method in the event as this.incrementScore [no parenthesis].
  render() {
    // console.log(this);  // --> the instance of the Counter class
