    // FIXTURES: to annotate methods that set things up every time an instance of the CreditorTest class is
    // created to run a single test case, e.g. all our test create a new Creditor(), so... DRY:

    private Creditor creditor;

    @Before  // Runs before a test. There's also a @BeforeClass, that run before ALL tests.
    public void setUp() throws Exception {

    // There's also @After / @AfterClass (AKA tear-down) which run after each test / all tests, respectively,
    // to clean up e.g. removing created test files

    // TEST CASES

    // Quick note: Tests should be F.I.R.S.T.:
    // F - Fast.
    // I - Isolated: make sure you are only testing what you intend to test.
    // R -  Repeatable: Every test run should return the same results.
    // S - Self-verifying. If tests are passing, you should feel safe that things are good to go to production.
    //     If they are failing, you should fix them, and trust that something indeed is broken. Trust trust trust.
    // T - Timely. Write tests either before or as you write code.
